gSOAP Public License 

Version 1.3 

The gSOAP public license is derived from the Mozilla Public License (MPL1.1). 

The sections that were deleted from the original MPL1.1 text are 1.0.1, 

2.1.(c),(d), 2.2.(c),(d), 8.2.(b), 10, and 11. Section 3.8 was added. 

The modified sections are 2.1.(b), 2.2.(b), 3.2 (simplified), 

3.5 (deleted the last sentence), and 3.6 (simplified). 



1 DEFINITIONS.

1.0.1. 

1.1. "Contributor" means each entity that creates or contributes to

 the creation of Modifications.

1.2. "Contributor Version" means the combination of the Original Code,

 prior Modifications used by a Contributor, and the Modifications made

 by that particular Contributor.

1.3. "Covered Code" means the Original Code, or Modifications or the

 combination of the Original Code, and Modifications, in each case

 including portions thereof.

1.4. "Electronic Distribution Mechanism" means a mechanism generally

 accepted in the software development community for the electronic

 transfer of data.

1.5. "Executable" means Covered Code in any form other than Source Code. 

1.6. "Initial Developer" 

 means the individual or entity identified as the Initial Developer in

 the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A.

1.7. "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or

 portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.

1.8. "License" means this document. 

1.8.1. "Licensable" means having the right to grant, to the maximum

 extent possible, whether at the time of the initial grant or

 subsequently acquired, any and all of the rights conveyed herein.

1.9. "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the

 substance or structure of either the Original Code or any previous

 Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a series of files, a

 Modification is:

 A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file

 containing Original Code or previous Modifications.

 B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code, or

 previous Modifications.

1.10. "Original Code" means Source Code of computer software code

 which is described in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A as

 Original Code, and which, at the time of its release under this

 License is not already Covered Code governed by this License.

1.10.1. "Patent Claims" means any patent claim(s), now owned or

 hereafter acquired, including without limitation, method, process, and

 apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by grantor.

1.11. "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Covered Code for

 plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to

 control compilation and installation of an Executable, or source

 code differential comparisons against either the Original Code

 or another well known, available Covered Code of the

 Contributor's choice. The Source Code can be in a compressed or

 archival form, provided the appropriate decompression or

 de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.

1.12. "You" (or "Your") means an individual or a legal entity

 exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of,

 this License or a future version of this License issued under

 Section 6.1. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity which

 controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with

 You. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (a) the

 power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management

 of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b)

 ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding

 shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.



2 SOURCE CODE LICENSE.

2.1. The Initial Developer Grant. 



The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, 

non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims: 

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)

 Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify,

 display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or

 portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of

 a Larger Work; and

(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial

 Developer, to make, have made, use and sell ("offer to sell and

 import") the Original Code, Modifications, or portions thereof,

 but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably

 necessary to enable You to utilize, alone or in combination with

 other software, the Original Code, Modifications, or any

 combination or portions thereof.





(c) 

(d) 



2.2. Contributor Grant. 



Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby 

grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license 

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or

 trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,

 display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications

 created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an

 unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or

 as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor,

 to make, have made, use and sell ("offer to sell and import") the

 Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the

 extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You

 to utilize, alone or in combination with other software, the

 Contributor Version (or portions thereof).

(c) 

(d) 



3 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.

3.1. Application of License. 



The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by 

the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The 

Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of 

this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, 

and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code 

You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code 

version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the 

recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document 

offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. 



3.2. Availability of Source Code. 



Any Modification created by You will be provided to the Initial Developer in 

Source Code form and are subject to the terms of the License. 



3.3. Description of Modifications. 



You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file 

documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of 

any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is 

derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial 

Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source 

Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation 

in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. 



3.4. Intellectual Property Matters. 

(a) Third Party Claims. 

If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual 

property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor 

under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source 

Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party 

making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to 

contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made 

available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the 

LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take 

other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) 

reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new 

knowledge has been obtained. 

(b) Contributor APIs. 

If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and 

Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to 

implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL 

file. 

(c) Representations. 

Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) 

above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's 

original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the 

rights conveyed by this License. 



3.5. Required Notices. 



You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If 

it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to 

its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a 

relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. 

If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a 

Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this 

License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients'

rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, 

and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations 

to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your 

own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. 



3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. 



You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of 

Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may distribute the 

Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your 

choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You 

are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the 

Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights 

in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You 

distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it 

absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by 

You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If you distribute 

executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you must 

reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials 

provided with the product. 



3.7. Larger Works. 



You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not 

governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a 

single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this 

License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 



3.8. Restrictions. 



You may not transfer rights to the Covered Code. 



4 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.



If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License 

with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, 

or regulation then You must: 

(a) comply with the terms of this License to the 

 maximum extent possible; and 

(b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such

 description must be included in the LEGAL file described in

 Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the

 Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or

 regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a

 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.



5 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.



This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the 

notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. 



6 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.



6.1. New Versions. 



Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to 

time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. 



6.2. Effect of New Versions. 



Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, 

You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also 

choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of 

the License. 



6.3. Derivative Works. 



If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do 

in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this 

License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrase "gSOAP" or any 

confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that 

your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that 

Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the gSOAP Public 

License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or 

Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be 

deemed to be modifications of this License.)

8 TERMINATION.

8.1. 

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if 

You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 

days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code 

which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.

of this License shall survive. 

8.2. 

8.3. 

If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that 

such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any 

patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior 

to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value 

of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be 

taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 



8.4. 

In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end

user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which

have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to

termination shall survive termination.



9 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY 

OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY 

OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, 

OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES 

FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND 

ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN 

INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL 

NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S 

NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME 

JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

10 U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

11 MISCELLANEOUS.

12 RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible 

for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization 

of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and 

Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing 

herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
 "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
 CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
 CompuServe Incorporated."

The following copyright notice and information applies to the above Excluded Components:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
IBM Public License Version 1.0 
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM PUBLIC LICENSE
("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

1. DEFINITIONS 

"Contribution" means: 

a) in the case of International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), the Original
 Program, and 
b) in the case of each Contributor, 
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are 
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from 
a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or 
anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include 
additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software 
distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license 
agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program. 

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily 
infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program. 

"Original Program" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement 
as released by IBM, including source code, object code and documentation, if any. 

"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions. 

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all 
Contributors. 

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a 
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative 
works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of 
such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a 
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, 
sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if 
any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination 
of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, 
such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. 
The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No 
hardware per se is licensed hereunder. 
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions 
set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe 
the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any 
liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual 
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, 
each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights 
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to 
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing 
the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its 
Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 
3. REQUIREMENTS 

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license 
agreement, provided that: 

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express 
and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied 
warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including 
direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; 
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor 
alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs 
licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for 
software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form: 

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 

Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program: 

Copyright (c) {date here}, International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights 
Reserved. 

In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, 
if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator 
of the Contribution. 

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end 
users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the 
commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial 
product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for 
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial 
product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend 
and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, 
damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal 
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent 
caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its 
distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this 
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual 
property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly 
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial 
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense
and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in 
any such claim at its own expense. 

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, 
Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor 
then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, 

the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to 
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any 
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. 

5. NO WARRANTY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, 
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the 
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with 
its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs 
of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or 
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL 
HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, 
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY 
WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, 
EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

7. GENERAL 

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not 
affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without 
further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent 
necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 


If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable 
to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted 
by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such 
litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding 
combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), 
then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed. 

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of
the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable
period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this
Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as 
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses 
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. 

IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each 
new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program 
(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement 
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, 
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new 
version. No one other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly 
stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the 
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by 
implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted 
under this Agreement are reserved. 

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual 
property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring 
a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. 
Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

1. Licensing the Work.
A. These terms and conditions for use, reproduction, distribution, and modification (the "License") apply to any original work of authorship (the "Work") containing a notice placed by the copyright owner (the "Licensor") indicating that the Work is licensed under the Day RI License, Version 1.0.
B. The Work is distributed by the Licensor as a reference implementation of a current or proposed industry standard, as defined by one or more "Specifications" listed within the license notice, where each such Specification is identified by title, revision label (or date if no label has been assigned), and Uniform Resource Identifier.
C. The Work may contain public class or interface declarations whose names begin with "java", "javax", "com.sun", or any recognized successors or replacements thereof (the "Restricted Name Space") that are restricted as per the Java Specification Participation Agreement between Licensor and Sun Microsystems, Inc.

2. You. "You" or "Your" means an individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by this License. By exercising any of the permissions granted to You in Sections 4 through 8 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms
and conditions.

3. Contributors and Contributions.
 
A. The Licensor and any individual or legal entity that voluntarily submits to the Licensor a Contribution to the Work are collectively addressed herein as "Contributors". For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. 
B. A "Contribution" is the original version of the Work and any modification or addition to the Work that has been submitted for inclusion in the Work, where such modifications and/or additions to the Work originate from that particular Contributor, or from some entity acting on behalf of that Contributor.
C. A Contribution is "submitted" when any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication is sent to the Licensor, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the Contributor as "Not a Contribution."

4. Contributor Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You:
(a) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, irrevocable copyright license under its licensable copyrights in the Work to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such derivative works in source code and object code form; and, 
(b) a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, irrevocable (subject to Section 5) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work and derivative works thereof, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution alone or by combination of their Contribution with the Work to which such Contribution was submitted by the Contributor. No assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Work does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. You assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.

5. Reciprocity. If You institute patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to You under this License shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work itself (excluding combinations of the Work with other software or hardware) infringes Your patent(s), then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

6. Redistribution without Modification. You may reproduce and distribute verbatim copies of the Work as You received it, in any medium, provided that You conspicuously publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty, keep
intact all of the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty, and give any other recipients of the Work a copy of this License along with the Work.

7. Redistribution with Modification. You may modify Your copy or copies of the Work or any portion of it, thus forming another work product based on the Work (a "Derivative Work"), and reproduce and distribute such modifications or the Derivative Work, provided that You also meet the following conditions:
(a) You must give any other recipients of the Derivative Work a copy of this License along with the Derivative Work.
(b) You must retain, in the source code of any Derivative Work that You distribute, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the source code of the Work, excluding those notices that only pertain to sections of the Work that have been excluded from the Derivative Work. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" file as part of its source code distribution, the Derivative Work must include a readable copy of the notices contained within that NOTICE file, excluding those notices that only pertain to sections of the Work that have been excluded from the Derivative Work, in at least one of the following places: 
 within a NOTICE file distributed as part of the Derivative Work; within the source code or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Work; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Work, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. You may add Your own notices alongside or as an addendum to the original NOTICE information. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the terms and conditions of this License.
(c) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files.
(d) You must do one of the following:
 (1) modify or remove all package, class, interface, field, and method declarations in the Derived Work such that no names within the Restricted Name Space remain in the Derived Work; or
 (2) fully implement the Specifications, or later revisions of those Specifications that are acknowledged by the Licensor as successors to the Specifications, without modifying, subsetting, supersetting, or otherwise extending the Restricted Name Space or including any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields, or methods within the Restricted Name Space other than those required/authorized by the Specifications being implemented, and pass the Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) for those Specifications; or
(3) cause the Derived Work to be clearly and conspicuously labeled as "unfinished and subject to change", "alpha release", "beta release", or "for research purposes only", and clearly and conspicuously identify within the documentation and packaging of the Derived Work that it is not compliant with the Specifications.

 You may add Your own copyright statement to such modifications and may provide (sublicense) additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, distribution or further modification of Your modifications, or for the Derivative Work as a whole, provided that the sublicense complies with the conditions stated in this License.

8. Redistribution with Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms"). However, You may do
so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.

9. Trademarks. Aside from reproduction of the information within the NOTICE file and references to the License itself, this License does not grant permission to use the trademarks, trade names, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary "fair use" while describing the origin of the Work. Further information on guidelines for use of related marks and/or how to obtain permission for use of those marks may be found in the NOTICE file, if any is included with the Work.

10. Disclaimer of Warranty. The Work is provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

11. Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of
any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

 perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such

 Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with

 other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work;

 and



(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of

 Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that

 Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor

 Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by

 Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.



3. Distribution Obligations. 



3.1 Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to

 which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,

 including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of

 Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License

 or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and

 You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source

 Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any

 Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of

 this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may

 include an additional document offering the additional rights

 described in Section 3.5.



3.2 Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or

 to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form

 under the terms of this License either on the same media as an

 Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution

 Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available;

 and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must

 remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it

 initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a

 subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made

 available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that

 the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic

 Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.



3.3 Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to

 which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You

 made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must

 include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,

 directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial

 Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the

 Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related

 documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the

 Covered Code.



3.4 Intellectual Property Matters. 

(a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has actual knowledge that a

 license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required

 to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1

 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code

 distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party

 making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom

 to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the

 Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,

 Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies

 Contributor makes available thereafter.



(b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an

 application programming interface and Contributor has actual knowledge

 of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that

 API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.



(c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed

 pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that

 Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)

 and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed

 by this License.



3.5 Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in

 each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such

 notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You

 must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)

 where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You

 created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a

 Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also

 duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where

 You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to

 Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,

 warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more

 recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own

 behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any

 Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,

 support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,

 and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every

 Contributor for any liability (excluding any liability arising from

 intellectual property claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by

 the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,

 support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.



3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered

 Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5

 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice

 stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available

 under the terms of this License, including a description of how and

 where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice

 must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,

 related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients'

 rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable

 version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your

 choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided

 that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the

 license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter

 the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set

 forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under

 a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms

 which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the

 Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify

 the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability

 (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property claims

 relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or

 such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.



3.7 Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered

 Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and

 distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You

 must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the

 Covered Code.



4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is

 impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License

 with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,

 judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms

 of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the

 limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be

 included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be

 included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the

 extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be

 sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to

 understand it.



5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to

 which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and

 to related Covered Code.



6. Versions of the License. 



6.1 New Versions. The Storage Networking Industry Association (the

 "SNIA") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from

 time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version

 number.



6.2 Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published

 under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to

 use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use

 such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the

 License published by the SNIA. No one other than the SNIA has the

 right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under

 this License.



6.3 Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this

 License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is

 not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)

 rename Your license so that the phrases "Storage Networking Industry

 Association," "SNIA," or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear

 in your license (except to note that your license differs from this

 License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the

 license contains terms which differ from the SNIA Public

 License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code

 or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of

 themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)



7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS

 LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER

 EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT

 THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A

 PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE

 QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY

 COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL

 DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY

 SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

 CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED

 CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.



8. TERMINATION. 



8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate

 automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure

 such breach within a reasonable time after becoming aware of the

 breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted

 shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by

 their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this

 License shall survive.



8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement

 claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial

 Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor

 against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")

 alleging that:

(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly

 infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such

 Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License

 shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,

 unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: 

 (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable

 reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made

 by such Participant, or

 (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor

 Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a

 reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed

 upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not

 withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections

 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60

 day notice period specified above.



8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant

 alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or

 indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as

 by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent

 infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses

 granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken

 into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or

 license.



8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all

 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)

 which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder

 prior to termination shall survive termination.



9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO

 LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR

 OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR

 ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH

 PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,

 INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,

 WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,

 COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL

 DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE

 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT

 APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH

 PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH

 LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR

 LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION

 AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.



10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a "commercial

 item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995),

 consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer

 software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212

 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48

 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government

 End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth

 herein.



11. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete agreement

 concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is

 held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the

 extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be

 governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable

 law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law

 provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on

 Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly

 excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a

 contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to

 this License.



12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the

 Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages

 arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights

 under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and

 Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable

 basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any

 admission of liability.



13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer may designate portions

 of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means

 that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the

 Covered Code under Your choice of this License or the alternative

 licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file

 described in Exhibit A.



14. ACCEPTANCE. This License is accepted by You if You retain, use,

 or distribute the Covered Code for any purpose.
